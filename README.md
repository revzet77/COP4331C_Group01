# COP4331C_Group01: A Combat Game for Creative Thinkers

Vision Statement

For gamers that are sick of basic point and shoot survivor games, this product offers an adaptive combat environment that leads to more innovative and creative gameplay, unlike games with very “robotic” state machines for their enemies. Our product offers enemies with an adaptive AI and procedural animation, aka the enemies will change their attack loop based on how the player acts.
