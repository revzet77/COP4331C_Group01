|----|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|-------|
| 004 | As a player, I want a weapons system so I can fight enemies. | 5 | NECESSARY | Given the player possesses a weapon, when the player presses the attack button, then the weapon equipped will fire projectiles and inflict damage. | John |
| 005 | As a player, I want to tell how much health an enemy has left so I know when my enemies will be destroyed. | 10 | IMPORTANT | Given that enemies are spawned, when the player damages them, then the enemies' health goes down accordingly and is displayed above them. | Jacqueline |
| 006 | As a player, I want to toggle between different weapons. | 5 | IMPORTANT | Given that weapons deal damage, when the player presses the swap weapon button, then a different weapon with different stats is equipped and can be fired. | John |
| 007 | As a player, I want to have interesting enemies that behave naturally so I am immersed in the game | 20 | MODERATE | Given that enemy models exist and can move, when the player behaves in a particular way, then the enemies alter their attack patterns and behaviors to create more challenge for the player. | John/Jacqueline |
| 008 | As a player, I want to know when I have succeeded or failed so the game feels rewarding. | 7 | MODERATE | Given the game is running, when the player wins or loses, then the game ends. | Wallace |
| 010 | As a player, I want a large area with varying terrain to fight. | 10 | NICE TO HAVE | Given the game has started, when I move my character around in a large area, then the complex terrain and map is properly traversed. | Gustaf |
| 012 | As a player, I want the enemies to effectively traverse the map to pursue me. | 15 | IMPORTANT | Given the enemy is instantiated and can move, when the player moves around the map, then the enemies will pursue and traverse the terrain to get within attack range of the player. | Jacqueline |
| 014 | As a player, I want animations and visual feedback from me firing my weapon. | 6 | NICE TO HAVE | Given a weapons system exists and damages enemies, when the player presses attack the equipped weapon fires, and when weapons are swapped a new weapon model is equipped. | Gustaf |
| 015 | As a player, I want my character to react accordingly when colliding with terrain or enemies. | 3 | IMPORTANT | Given a level exists that the player model can move in, when the player moves the model into an enemy or piece of terrain it collides and doesn't phase through it. | Wallace |
