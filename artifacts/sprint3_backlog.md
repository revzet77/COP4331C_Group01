| ID | User Story | Effort | Priority | Validation Criteria | Owner |
|----|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|-------|
| 000 | As a player, I want my convential third person gaming so the controls are inuitive. | 10 | NECESSARY | Given the game is started, when I move my mouse and use 'WASD' to control my character, then the character moves and aims accordingly. | John |
| 013 | As a player, I want my character to visually respond to my controller inputs. | 6 | NICE TO HAVE | Given the player exists and can move, when the player model moves around, then animations are played to convey the movement more realistically. | Gustaf |
| 011 | As a player, I want to be able to see the status of my health and weaponry. | 7 | IMPORTANT | Given the player has health and weaponry, when the player takes damage or swaps weapons, then the user interface shows the corresponding values. | Wallace |
| 001 | As a player, I want my avatar to move around an environment so I can explore | 9 | NECESSARY | Given the game has started, when I move my character around, then the terrain and map around is properly traversed. | Jacqueline |
| 002 | As a player, I want to have enemies to fight. | 8 | NECESSARY | Given the game has started, when I spawn into the map, then enemies with one attack pattern will chase me. | Jacqueline/John |
| 007 | As a player, I want to have interesting enemies that behave naturally so I am immersed in the game | 20 | MODERATE | Given that enemy models exist and can move, when the player behaves in a particular way, then the enemies alter their attack patterns and behaviors to create more challenge for the player. | Jacqueline/John |
